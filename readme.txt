Turn your WooCommerce store into a beautiful catalog. Let your customers quickly ask about products they like using enquiry forms on products!

== Description ==
Change your existing ecommerce site into a catalog, let your customers ask questions about products you sell!
It will let you change your existing ecommerce site into a catalog, where customers can browse your products, but they cannot buy them directly through WooCommerce cart.
To keep their intereset, you can turn on a second mode, which will add a product enquiry form on product page instead of an add to cart button! You can also enable product enquiry mode WITHOUT disabling ecommerce part of your store.
This will make your customers life easier in case they have any questions about your products.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wb-product-enquiry` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Product Enquiry->Settings screen to configure the plugin and enable modes you want.
4. Enjoy!
